# Portfolio

A simple, responsive portfolio site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Customize

1. **Your info** – In `index.html`, replace:
   - "Your Name" with your name (hero, footer, contact)
   - "your.email@example.com" with your email
   - LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter URLs with your profiles

2. **About** – Edit the about section text and the highlight numbers (e.g. years of experience, projects).

3. **Skills** – Update the skill cards to match your stack.

4. **Projects** – For each project card:
   - Replace the placeholder div with an `<img>` if you have a screenshot
   - Change title, description, and the "Live" / "Code" links

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in a browser, or use a simple server:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Node (if you have npx)
npx serve
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Deploy

- **GitHub Pages**: Push to a repo, enable Pages in Settings, choose the branch (e.g. `main`) and root folder.
- **Netlify**: Drag the folder to [netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop) or connect your repo.
- **Vercel**: Import the project and deploy.

No build step required.
